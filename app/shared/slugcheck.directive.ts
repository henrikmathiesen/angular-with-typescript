// Directives are widget like components that are self contained and used through the DOM
// Therefor the code for directives are not used in other parts of the app
// As a result they take on a hybrid approach when writing them in typescript
//
// Since we wont expose the directive to other parts of the app, we do NOT write an interface
// There is also little benefit in writing the directive as a class
//
// But there could be a good idea to type the scope that is exposed to the view, so its clearer by reading the interface?


// An iifi for clouser
// - return an anonymous object instead of following the Pluralsight course pattern, else ng-annoate wont work
